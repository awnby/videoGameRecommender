# videoGameRecommender
Hello! This is a video game recommendation system that I worked on with two of my university friends early in 2023.

Having taken a Data Mining course together, we were excited at the thought of building our own recommendation system, given how important they are to our everyday lives. 
Wherever you go, companies spend a huge chunk of their money dedicated to not only advertising their product to the general public, but rather catering their advertisements
to the consumers who would be the most interested. Essentially, almost everything you see has been, in some way, chosen for you specifically to see. Scary, but exciting!
So, when we came up with the idea to work on this small project, we were stumped on what recommender system to build. Well, what better domain to work in than the one you
already know best: video games.

Despite what your parents tell you, video games are crucial to society, and won't be going away anytime soon (take that, Mom!). But gone are the days of getting an ad on TV to 
play a new game that you beg your parents to buy for you, or even walking blindly into a GameStop and picking the game that speaks to you the most (in this case, judging a book
by its cover is valid...). Nowadays, we have become more accustomed to allowing the algorithm dictate what we see on a daily basis. I, personally, no longer search for games on 
Steam but rather scroll mindlessly down the endless page of recommendations that Valve has to offer.

But there's one problem. I don't think their recommendation system really works that well. Or at least for me. So, let's try and make one ourselves.

In order to do so, we will be using two datasets: the IMDB dataset of video games AND the Steam dataset of user activity. The former has a primary key of video games registered
on IMDB, with their genres and ratings and such, while the latter has a primary key of users and their playtime for a whole host of games. Each dataset has over 10,000 entries! So, 
we thought this would be perfect for this project.

To read more on this project, look to the report that we wrote on our findings! Looking back at this project, I hope to continue this later some day soon (maybe once I get an internship)
exploring more of what's possible with this dataset, outside the scope of our Data Mining course. Enjoy!
